      		<h2>	Statistical approach for distance estimation using Inverse Perspective Mapping on embedded platform<br></h2>
      		<strong><p>The algorithm for remote object distance estimation in driving assisstnace,images of msart phones !.</strong> </p>
<br>
      		A mono vision distance estimation algorithm which can be used for various applications such as obstacle avoidance in case
      		of an autonomous slow moving vehicle (ASMV) has been devised. The accurate estimation of the distance of the obstacle from
      		camera position was determined using statistical analysis.An accuracy of about 90 % was achieved. 
      		The results obtained with statistical approach enhance the performance of the system and make it ideal for real time processing
      		of closed loop obstacle avoidance control mechanism of an ASMV. The accuracy achieved is very high and nearly
      		equals that obtained by stereo vision mechanism. The added advantage of the proposed algorithm is that no prior 
      		information is needed about the object to be detected and calibration needs to be just once during system installation
      		for distance estimation for a particular environment. The algorithm also takes care of non-ideal behavior of the camera 
      		lens and tries to eliminate it by carrying out un-distortion. The adaptive thresholding mechanism eliminates need of a fixed
      		threshold value, thereby addressing an important problem of most of the thresholding algorithms used in image processing.
      		      		Considering the multiple constraints of mono-vision distance estimation approach, the proposed algorithm can be thought as a low cost and efficient solution to the problem.	</p>

      		<h2>Robust and Adaptive Traffic Surveillance System for
Urban Intersections on Embedded Platform <br></h2>
      		<strong><p> A reliable traffic flow monitoring and traffic analysis
approach using computer vision.</strong> </p>
<p>
<br> The project presents a real time traffic monitoring
system that makes use of image processing algorithm to detect and
estimate the of count of vehicles using motion detection approach.
Traffic congestion is a serious issue, which is the root cause of a
series of serious problems. Conventional traffic light controllers
have limitations because they make use of the predefined
hardware, whose functioning is governed according to program
that does not have the flexibility of modification on real time basis.
The proposed system makes use of a differential algorithm in
order to determine the signaling duration of each lane of
intersection. The system provides different delays for different
junctions thus optimizing the waiting time of each user. This
flexibility of timing and controlling prevents the congestion of
vehicles in squares due to high waiting time for the green ligh.
The proposed system guarantees a high success rate for
minimizing the traffic density at heavily crowded urban
Intersections. Currently, in absence of automated signal control
techniques, the traffic lights are either statically calibrated, or
controlled by on-road policemen, or remotely controlled by
manually seeing video feeds at the traffic control room. In such
a situation, the proposed algorithm ensures adaptive and robust
monitoring on a real time basis. The system can be installed for
N joints intersection, multi-lane traffic flow and can be
integrated as a part of a holistic traffic safety system. Very few
measurements are required, since most of the work is
computational. This system is robust and it is least affected by
disturbances and inaccuracy in measurement. The future scope
of the paper includes implementation of image processing
algorithm on an embedded platform. This will help in faster
processing and reducing power consumption. Further
improvisations include dynamic setting of region of motion
detection depending on the traffic flow. This can be done with
the help of neuro-fuzzy techniques. The approach can be
extended to N-intersection so that installation and
implementation will become generalized.

      		<h2>DTMF based Home Automation System <br></h2>
      		<strong><p> A reliable traffic flow monitoring and traffic analysis
approach using computer vision.</strong> </p>
<p>
<br>Traditionally  electrical  appliances  in  a  home  are  controlled  via  switches  that  regulate  the 
electricity to these devices.Home automation  is  becoming  more  and 
more  popular  around  the  world  and  is  becoming  a  common practice.   The   process   of   home   automation   
works   by   making   everything   in the   house automatically controlled using technology to control and do the
jobs that we would normally do manually.
In this project , a  unique  System  for  Home  automation  utilizing  Dual  Tone  Multi  Frequency (DTMF) is proposed.It is   is 
paired  with  a  wireless  module  to  provide  seamless  wireless  control  over  many devices in a house. 
This user console has many keys,each corresponding to the device that needs to be activated. 
The user can remotely perform status check of each appliance like the Air Conditioner, Water Control Motor etc
and chnage the status. A voice feedback circuit guides the user to receiver acknowledgements of his actions.
The prototype was implemented using Atmega Microcontroller,DTMF Decoder circuit,Voice playback circuit and  sensors and the circuit was fabricated on pcb.

      		<h2>Traffic Monitoring at Chaotic Urban Intersections<br></h2>
      		<strong><p>Analysis and Monitoring of a High Density Traffic Flow at T-Intersection Using
Statistical Computer Vision Based Approach </strong> </p>
<p>
<br> A reliable traffic flow monitoring and traffic analysis
approach using computer vision techniques has been proposed
in this work. The exponential increase in traffic density at
urban intersections in the past few decades has raised precious
and challenging demands to computer vision algorithms and
technological solutions. The focus of this algorithm is to suggest a
statistical based approach to determine the traffic parameters
at heavily crowded urban intersections. The algorithm in
addition to accurate tracking and counting of freeway traffic
also offers high efficiency for determining vehicle count at a
high traffic density T-intersection. The system uses Intel Open
CV library for image processing. The implementation of
algorithm is done using C++. The real time video sequence is
obtained from a stationary camera placed atop a high building
overlooking the particular T intersection. The work suggests a
dynamic method where each vehicle at a T intersection is
passed through a number of detection zones and the final count
of vehicles is derived from a statistical equation. The practical implementation of the algorithm
achieves an accuracy upto 92%.

      		<h2>LOWFER Software defined Radio using Tayloe Quadrature Sampling Detector<br></h2>
      		
<p>
<br> In this  work,the aim was to design an architecture for optimum performance in the LOWFER spectrum using software defined radios.
This led to the  development  of a  low  cost  receiver  for  LowFER  using  Tayloe  QSD  for down conversion of the received RF  Frequency  instead  of  a  traditional 
homodyne/superheterodyne  mixer. The design uses a direct conversion process that can be used for up conversion as well as down conversion.Using locally available off-the-shelf components, the
design was successfully implemented  at the breadboard  level,  and  interfaced  with  PC  through  PC soundcard.
GNU  Radio  used  for  processing  of  received  I  and  Q  samples,  with  function generators used for generating 
the incoming RF and local oscillator signals. The project gave an  insight  into  the  world  of  software  defined  radio
and  the  challenges  associated  with hardware  realization.The  design  required  several  iterations  to  get  all  the 
blocks  to  work perfectly. Issues like non-availability of components mismatch and burnouts were faced in plenty. 
Setting up the GNU radio environment and interfacing with the I and Q signals was an iterative process too.

      		<h2>Analysis and Stochastic Modelling of
Interference Patterns for Cellular Networks</h2>
      		<strong><p>A power optimal strategy for machine to machine communication!.</strong> </p>
<br>
      		The Internet of things envisages to create a plethora of heterogeneous objects and machines
interconnected to each other to form a global system of systems that will ease and simplify the
human tasks in countless ways. The possibility of every object acting as node that transmits and
receives data at every moment to be a part of an interconnected ecosystem puts tremendous
stress on the existing wireless technology. This shifts the focus of existing wireless technology to
model the flow of data from human generated type to the machine generated traffic. Considering
that most of the machines transmit majority of data on the uplink and conditioned on their
inaccessible and remote locations, the metrics for their efficient performance demand a change
in the existing architectures. Power efficient and self-sustaining systems will guarantee optimum
performance in the IoT environment. The translation of every device into a transmitting node
will also introduce tremendous interference in the system and modelling the performance of such
an in presence of interference is of utmost importance. 
<br>Considering the spatial distribution of
such devices will no longer be regular, the tools of stochastic geometry are exploited to model the
interference and the impact on the various nodes in presence of the different strategies employed
for the system like CDMA or FDMA. The project thus aims to analyze the strategies that ensure
the optimum performance of machine to machine communication in presence of interference and
derive values for certain key metrics. On the lines of this approach, the focus is to further develop
a unified framework for modelling all the key performance metrics in presence of interference
and ensure optimum performance of the IoT system.	</p>
